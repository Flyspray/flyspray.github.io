> We have 4 installations of Flyspray in our company. One has a custom skin that is designed specifically for non-technical users. In this installation new task form has separate fields for entering steps, expected and actual result. This is all merged into standard task description. On our side we use standard Flyspray installation connected to the same database. This is used by our IT stuff to provide support for customers only. We call it Bibz.

>Two other installations are used for our internal purposes. We use them to plan new versions and simply get things done. So both are used by programmers and PMs and the main is called Bugz. IT stuff copies tasks from the Bibz if they decide programmers need to work on it. We have an extra tool that assists copying tasks from Bibz to Bugz (pre-fills most form fields).

>We also have ISO 9001 quality certificate. Auditors were quite impressed with Flyspray and very surprised when I said it was free. It would be much, much harder to get the certificate and re-certification if not for the Flyspray. It all makes quality assurance almost effortless.

We use Flyspray as our main bugtracker for our products.

These projects moved from a self hosted Flyspray to github (most around 2014), only keeping old tasks in their Flyspray install:

 * [Dokuwiki](http://bugs.splitbrain.org/)
 * [IRSSI](http://bugs.irssi.org) - a terminal based IRC client for UNIX systems
