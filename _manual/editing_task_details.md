Developers need to update tasks as they work on them, so Flyspray makes this easy.  While [viewing task details](/manual/viewing_task_details), click the *Edit this Task* button to switch to "edit mode".  **Note:** You need to have permission to edit that particular task to enter "edit mode".  This means that one of the following criteria needs to be met and the task is **not closed**:

  * The task is assigned to you, and you are in a group with the *Edit own tasks* permission, or
  * You are in a group with the *Edit all tasks* permission, or
  * You are the creator of the task and 24h have not yet passed since creation

If you meet at least one of the above criteria, you will see a page similar to the one shown below.

Most fields are a straightforward. Here is some additional info though:

  * Any **Date** field: Check the [page about date and time info](/manual/datetime)
  * **Mark Private**: This will make a task invisible to everyone apart from project managers (or admins) and people who are assigned to a task. Can only be set by project managers.

If you have made some changes and want to revert to how the task was when you first entered "edit mode", click the *Reset* button.  When you are happy with your changes, click the *Save Details* button to save and return to [view mode](/manual/viewing_task_details).

#### Tips
  * There is no need to enter "edit mode" to assign a task to yourself.  You just need to click the *Assign to me* button.
  * Likewise, you do not need to edit a task to close it.  See [closing tasks](/manual/closing_tasks).
