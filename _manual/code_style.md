# Flyspray code style

Basically we use PSR-12 https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/ for new Code with following exceptions or added rules:

### Indentation

We use **tabs** instead of the 4 spaces for indenting.

### Variables

* Use only English for variable names.
* Give variables a matching meaning, not too long, not too short.

* camelCase functions for PHP (they are case insensitive, so nothing breaks, but prefered format)
* lowercase new introduced variables for PHP (they are case sensitive!)

## PHPdoc

Use phpdoc syntax if you want document functions or classes.
