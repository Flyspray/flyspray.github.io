As soon as a task is opened, Flyspray starts logging changes to that task in the History. If you are a member of a group with the *View History* permission, you can view the History Tab by clicking the History heading.

There are a wide variety of things logged to the history, including all changed fields, [comments](/manual/comments) added and edited, files attached, [notifications](/manual/notifications) list changes etc. The history keeps track of old and new fields, and the person who made the changes. Keeping track of all these things allows for comprehensive [reports](/manual/reports) to be generated by Project Managers.
