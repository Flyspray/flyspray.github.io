<h2>Help Flyspray to get localized to your native language</h2>

Want your language strings updated with the next Flyspray release? Pick your language file on https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/tree/master/lang , edit and make a pull request.

To compare current text strings between languages and see what strings need to change, Flyspray comes with an integrated translation tool:

You can find it in the Flyspray admin section and has currently 2 more views:

  * A diff report overview: which strings are missing, not used anymore and direct comparision between english and a language
  * The editing view for your local translation customization. But it should be prefered to upstream you translations to https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/ !
