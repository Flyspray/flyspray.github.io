<h3>Help Flyspray to get localized to your native language</h3>

Want your language strings updated with the next Flyspray release? Pick your language file on [the FlySpray github repository](https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/tree/master/lang), edit and make a pull request.

To compare current text strings between languages and see what strings need to change, Flyspray comes with an integrated translation tool:

You can find it in the Flyspray admin section and has currently 2 more views:

  * A diff report overview: which strings are missing, not used anymore and direct comparision between English and a language.
  * The editing view for your local translation customization. But it should be prefered to upstream you translations to [the github repository](https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/)!
