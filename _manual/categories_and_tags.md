Should tasks be categorized by **categories** or **tags** - or **both**?

With Flyspray 1.0 tags are supported. They are just labels that can be applied to tasks.

The differences between **categories** and **tags** in Flyspray 1.0 are:

## Categories


#### Good

  - A category can have one default assigned user, who can gets assigned automatically to each task created in that category.
  - The category filter is available in the extended search
  
#### Neutral

  - Can be grouped in a hierarchy tree.

#### Bad

  - A task can only be in one category.


## Tags

#### Good

  - multiple tags per task

#### Bad

  - not searchable or filterable yet (planned for FS1.1)
  - no grouping of tags (taxonomy)
  
  
## TODO

Examples -  what is good for categories and which are better done as tags.
