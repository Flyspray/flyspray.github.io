The documentation can be improved [on the github repository](https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray.github.io). Just go there, open yourself an account (if you don't have one yet), and start forking and submitting a PR (Pull Request).

Note that all over the documentation, the correct spelling is `Flyspray` (just a **F** capital letter).

Thank you for your contribution!
