Viewing a task's details is easy, if the Project Manager has assigned you the right permissions. Simply click a task in the task list, or enter the task id into the Show Task box and press enter. You will be taken to a screen similar to the one below.

Sufficient permissions are in place if you

  * opened the task anonymously and access the task with the *task token* included in the URL, or
  * you are the creator of the task (not anonymous), or
  * you are assigned to the task, or
  * you have the global or at least project level *view_tasks* permission and the task is not private, or
  * you are the project manager.

Also, you must be able to view a project to be able to view its task. **Being able to view a project and being able to see tasks of a project are different permissions**
