## Some suggestions

- Please do not put too much into one pull request (PR). To ease reviewing and testing, it is prefered that a PR handles only one single problem. That because one obstacle/problem and it delays the possible good stuff to merge.
- Please give pull requests a meaningful summary to make the review process easier.

If you wish to, you can **[contribute documentation](/manual/writing_documentation)** here.
