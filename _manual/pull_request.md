## Some rules

- Please do not put too much into one PR. To ease reviewing and testing, it is prefered that a pull request handles only one single problem. That because one obstacle/problem and it delays the possible good stuff to merge.
- Please give pull requests a good summary, `$name fixes` as an example, to make the review process easier.

If you whish to, you can **[contribute documentation](/manual/writing_documentation)** here.
